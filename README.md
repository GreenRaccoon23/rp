# rp
Go package/program to replace strings within files.  

Install:  
`go install github.com/GreenRaccoon23/rp`  
Clone:  
`go get github.com/GreenRaccoon23/rp`  

Basically, it works like `sed -i "s/${old}/${new}/" "${file}"` but with a recursive option.  
I decided to upload this package because I use it *all the time*. Someone else might find it useful too.
